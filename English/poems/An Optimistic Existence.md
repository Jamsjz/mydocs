# An Optimistic Existence
Why don't you like, the feeling that you'll die?

Oh yes my friend, it is the truth.

Every little turn is a risk bearing lies.

So mind your tone that goes through your tooth.

---

Every step you take is a step towards death

That's why you will ever not fail

What you can, You should earn all health.

And may you make an everlasting trail.

---

You may say if we're all going to die,

Why should we care about the world?

Why should we keep on bearing those lies?

Why should we care of this wonderful world?

---

The thing is that you want to be happy.

You want to live good together in peace.

You want your name, to go on eternally.

You want a life with someone you can kiss.

---

We all love someone who doesn't exist in the present

We all have a faith, 

that when we become that someone of others

We will get a glance of our someone

---

This is the tragedy of life in its simplicity.

But it is the beauty of faith.

Faith, that gives a meaning to life

Faith, that gives courage in life.

Faith, that gives us hope in all the ways

is always inhabiting within us.

---

You are everyone and everyone is you

It's just that everybody sees

What you cannot view

So when everyone conceives

You believe

but that someone,

Nobody can see

---

You love someone

Actually many people

You have a faith in them

That when other anyone

Actually many people

Find you,

They won't put you in shame

---

So when only you, only you have a way

When you have your heart in what you want to do

Do not hesitate when you have a say

And when all knowing spirit is possessing you.
