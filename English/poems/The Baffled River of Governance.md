# The Baffled River of Governance

Politics is an act, its just that, all night and day.

Chasing after ignorant voices that lead them all the way

With an opaque understanding of the societal gears.

In all the foggy years but always so vague.

---

Politics, like a river, flows fast and wide

with lots of unions surfing in its tides.

Some be swept in its current, now and then.

Flustered by the scaring sound from the lion's den.

---

Politics like a game of cards is full of lies and tricks.

Interesting play it is and a beautiful mask of deceit.

And the river of unknown depths, that has baffled all the men.

From a steady flow to tsunamis, only with a stroke of pen.

---

Confusion leads to confusion, that is no big tale.

With the baffled river on its way, wouldn't it ever fail?

While they're excited for a swimming match to race in the dirty river.

But they now no longer differ from the cause of their own shiver.

---

They had a catch for something, but it's no such a big deal.

They forgot what to see, what to listen, hear and feel.

They had a catch for something, the dreams they once admired.

But now it's all dust from the ignorance inspired.
