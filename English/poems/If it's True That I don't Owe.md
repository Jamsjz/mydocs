# If it's true that I don't Owe
I own myself.

No one but me owns me

For any purpose they are to fulfill

or gain some pride

---

I find myself.

In a caged situation

Where I loose myself in wonders

Of what I could be and hide.

---

I wonder myself.

In being unloved and unnoticed

For I then have no leftovers

Or someone I owe

---

I find myself.

In a place where all are disappointed

By me trying so hard and failing to become

Someone I don't know

---

I hurt myself.

For I think I can hurt others

And the horrible but possible things I may do

When I go insane.

---

I distract myself,

As I think or maybe overthink about

Everything in the people's reality and I'm not just so

In the right lane

---

I make believe myself,

I exist like a creature that has been created

Not by want or love but a medium to one's

Dreams come true

---

I find myself,

Asking if I go away, the feeling

Of indebtedness would ever go and I would be

Stuck in this queue.
